🎮 **Memory Game**

Welcome to my Memory Game repository! 🧠🃏

This project is a result of my hands-on experience in a Generative AI workshop, where I delved into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and challenging Memory Game.

🌟 **Key Features:**
--> 8x8 grid of emojis for a memory challenge.
--> Responsive design with a dynamic grid layout.
--> Real-time move counter to track your progress.
--> Refresh button for a new game experience.
--> Special "win" emoji reveals when pairs are correctly matched!

🚀 **How to Play:**
Simply click on the cards to reveal the hidden emojis. Match pairs to win the game! Challenge your memory and have fun!

🔗 **Project Structure:**
**index.html:** The main HTML file containing the game structure.
**style.css:** CSS styles for a visually appealing user interface.
**script.js:** JavaScript code for game logic and interactivity.

🙌 **Acknowledgments:**
A big shoutout to the mentors and fellow participants in the Generative AI workshop for the inspiration and support throughout this learning journey.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this project as a learning resource. Happy coding! 💻✨
